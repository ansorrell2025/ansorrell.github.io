I love astrophysics and art!  
I also enjoy playing guitar and love video games

## Recommendation Websites!

- [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Lm9SZf2XFCc?si=-T05fsFUZvsWPAyA)  

 I absolutely love watching long lecture videos such as these.  
 I can sleep to them and learn from that at the same time! Convenient, right?

- [Gaming Website](https://neal.fun/)  

 Neal.fun provides tons of cool free games that are pretty unique.
